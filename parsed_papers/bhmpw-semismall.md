We give a semi-small orthogonal decomposition of the Chow
ring of a matroid M. The decomposition is used to give simple
proofs of Poincaré duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and
the Hodge–Riemann relations for the Chow ring, recovering
the main result of [1]. We also introduce the augmented Chow
ring of M and show that a similar semi-small orthogonal
decomposition holds for the augmented Chow ring.

Decomposition theorem

1. Introduction
A matroid M on a ﬁnite set E is a nonempty collection of subsets of E, called ﬂats of
M, that satisﬁes the following properties:
(1) The intersection of any two ﬂats is a ﬂat.
(2) For any ﬂat F , any element in E \ F is contained in exactly one ﬂat that is minimal
among the ﬂats strictly containing F .
Throughout, we suppose in addition that M is a loopless matroid:
(3) The empty subset of E is a ﬂat.
We write L(M) for the lattice of all ﬂats of M. Every maximal ﬂag of proper ﬂats of M
has the same cardinality d, called the rank of M. A matroid can be equivalently deﬁned
in terms of its independent sets or the rank function. For background in matroid theory,
we refer to [25] and [28].
The ﬁrst aim of the present paper is to decompose the Chow ring of M as a module
over the Chow ring of the deletion M \i (Theorem 1.2). The decomposition resembles the
decomposition of the cohomology ring of a projective variety induced by a semi-small
map. In Section 4, we use the decomposition to give a simple proof of the Kähler package
for the Chow ring: Poincaré duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge–Riemann
relations. This recovers the main result of [1].
The second aim of the present paper is to introduce the augmented Chow ring of M,
which contains the graded Möbius algebra of M as a subalgebra. We give an analogous
semi-small decomposition of the augmented Chow ring of M as a module over the augmented Chow ring of the deletion M \ i (Theorem 1.5), and use this to prove the Kähler
package for the augmented Chow ring. These results play a major role in the follow-up
paper [4], where we prove the Top-Heavy conjecture along with the nonnegativity of the
coeﬃcients of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial of a matroid.
Remark 1.1. The main objects of study in [4] are combinatorial abstractions of intersection cohomology groups of singular algebraic varieties. In contrast, the objects of study
in this paper are combinatorial abstractions of cohomology groups (or Chow rings) of
smooth projective varieties.
1.1. Let S M be the ring of polynomials with variables labeled by the nonempty
proper ﬂats of M:
S M := Q[xF |F is a nonempty proper ﬂat of M].

The Chow ring of M, introduced by Feichtner and Yuzvinsky in [17], is the quotient
algebra1
CH(M) := S M /(I M + J M ),
where I M is the ideal generated by the linear forms

i1 ∈F

xF −



xF , for every pair of distinct elements i1 and i2 of E,

i2 ∈F

and J M is the ideal generated by the quadratic monomials
xF1 xF2 , for every pair of incomparable nonempty proper ﬂats F1 and F2 of M.
When E is nonempty, the Chow ring of M admits a degree map
degM : CHd−1 (M) −→ Q,

xF :=



xF −→ 1,

F ∈F

where F is any complete ﬂag of nonempty proper ﬂats of M (Deﬁnition 2.15). For any
integer k, the degree map deﬁnes the Poincaré pairing
CHk (M) × CHd−k−1 (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ degM (η1 η2 ).

If M is realizable over a ﬁeld,2 then the Chow ring of M is isomorphic to the Chow ring
of a smooth projective variety over the ﬁeld (Remark 2.16).
Let i be an element of E, and let M \ i be the deletion of i from M. By deﬁnition,
M \ i is the matroid on E \ i whose ﬂats are the sets of the form F \ i for a ﬂat F of M.
The Chow rings of M and M \ i are related by the graded algebra homomorphism
θi = θM
i : CH(M \ i) −→ CH(M),

xF −→ xF + xF ∪i ,

where a variable in the target is set to zero if its label is not a ﬂat of M. As we will see
in Section 3, this homomorphism is induced by a projection from the Bergman fan of M
to the Bergman fan of M \ i. Let CH(i) be the image of the homomorphism θi , and let
Si be the collection
Si = Si (M)


= F |F is a nonempty proper subset of E \i such that F ∈ L(M) and F ∪ i ∈ L(M) .
1
A slightly diﬀerent presentation for the Chow ring of M was used in [17] in a more general context. The
present description was used in [1], where the Chow ring of M was denoted A(M). For a comparison of the
two presentations, see [3].
2
We say that M is realizable over a ﬁeld F if there exists a linear subspace V ⊆ F E such that S ⊆ E is
independent if and only if the projection from V to F S is surjective. Almost all matroids are not realizable
over any ﬁeld [24].

The element i is said to be a coloop of M if the ranks of M and M \ i are not equal. Thus,
Si is the collection of all nonempty proper subsets F of E \ i such that F ∪ i is a ﬂat of
M and i is a coloop in MF ∪i .
Theorem 1.2. If i is not a coloop of M, there is a direct sum decomposition of CH(M)
into indecomposable graded CH(M \ i)-modules
CH(M) = CH(i) ⊕



xF ∪i CH(i) .

(D1 )

F ∈Si

All pairs of distinct summands are orthogonal for the Poincaré pairing of CH(M). If i is
a coloop of M, there is a direct sum decomposition of CH(M) into indecomposable graded
CH(M \ i)-modules3
CH(M) = CH(i) ⊕ xE\i CH(i) ⊕



xF ∪i CH(i) .

(D2 )

F ∈Si

All pairs of distinct summands except for the ﬁrst two are orthogonal for the Poincaré
pairing of CH(M).
We write rkM : 2E → N for the rank function of M. For any proper ﬂat F of M, we
set4
MF := the localization of M at F , a loopless matroid on F of rank equal to rkM (F ),
MF := the contraction of M by F , a loopless matroid on E \ F of rank equal to d − rkM (F ).

The lattice of ﬂats of MF can be identiﬁed with the lattice of ﬂats of M that are contained
in F , and the lattice of ﬂats of MF can be identiﬁed with the lattice of ﬂats of M that
contain F . The CH(M \i)-module summands in the decompositions (D1 ) and (D2 ) admit
isomorphisms5
CH(i) ∼
= CH(M \ i) and xF ∪i CH(i) ∼
= CH(MF ∪i ) ⊗ CH(MF )[−1],
(Propositions 3.4 and 3.5). In addition, if i is a coloop of M, then
xE\i CH(i) ∼
= CH(M \ i)[−1].
When E = {i}, we treat the symbol x∅ as zero in the right-hand side of (D2 ).
The symbols MF and MF appear inconsistently in the literature, sometimes this way and sometimes
interchanged. The localization is frequently called the restriction. On the other hand, the contraction is
also sometimes called the restriction, especially in the context of hyperplane arrangements, so we avoid the
word restriction to minimize ambiguity.
5
For a graded vector space V , we write V [m] for the graded vector space whose degree k piece is equal
to V k+m .

Remark 1.3. When M is the Boolean matroid on E, the graded dimension of CH(M) is
 
given by the Eulerian numbers kd , and the decomposition (D2 ) specializes to the known
quadratic recurrence relation
sd (t) = sd−1 (t) + t

d−1
sk (t)sd−k−1 (t),

s0 (t) = 1,

k=0

where sk (t) is the k-th Eulerian polynomial [26, Theorem 1.5].
1.2. We also give similar decompositions for the augmented Chow ring of M, which
we now introduce. Let SM be the ring of polynomials in two sets of variables
SM := Q[yi |i is an element of E] ⊗ Q[xF |F is a proper ﬂat of M].
The augmented Chow ring of M is the quotient algebra
CH(M) := SM /(IM + JM ),
where IM is the ideal generated by the linear forms
yi −



xF , for every element i of E,

i∈F
/

and JM is the ideal generated by the quadratic monomials
xF1 xF2 , for every pair of incomparable proper ﬂats F1 and F2 of M, and
yi xF , for every element i of E and every proper ﬂat F of M not containing i.
The augmented Chow ring of M admits a degree map
degM : CHd (M) −→ Q,

xF :=



xF −→ 1,

F ∈F

where F is any complete ﬂag of proper ﬂats of M (Deﬁnition 2.15). For any integer k,
the degree map deﬁnes the Poincaré pairing
CHk (M) × CHd−k (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ degM (η1 η2 ).

If M is realizable over a ﬁeld, then the augmented Chow ring of M is isomorphic to the
Chow ring of a smooth projective variety over the ﬁeld (Remark 2.16).
Remark 1.4. The subring of the augmented Chow ring generated by the elements yi is
isomorphic to the graded Möbius algebra H(M) (Proposition 2.18), and we have isomorphisms

6

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

CH(M) ∼
= CH(M)/ideal(yi )i∈E ∼
= CH(M) ⊗H(M) Q.
The H(M)-module structure of CH(M) will be studied in detail in the forthcoming paper
[4]. In this paper, the graded Möbius algebra will not appear outside of Proposition 2.18.
As before, we write M \ i for the matroid obtained from M by deleting the element i.
The augmented Chow rings of M and M \ i are related by the graded algebra homomorphism
θi = θiM : CH(M \ i) −→ CH(M),

xF −→ xF + xF ∪i ,

where a variable in the target is set to zero if its label is not a ﬂat of M. As we will
see in Section 3, this homomorphism is induced by a projection from the augmented
Bergman fan of M to the augmented Bergman fan of M \ i. Let CH(i) be the image of
the homomorphism θi , and let Si be the collection


Si = Si (M) := F |F is a proper subset of E \ i such that F ∈ L(M) and F ∪ i ∈ L(M) .
Equivalently, Si can be deﬁned as the collection of all proper subsets F of E \ i such that
F ∪ i is a ﬂat of M and i is a coloop in MF ∪i .
Theorem 1.5. If i is not a coloop of M, there is a direct sum decomposition of CH(M)
into indecomposable graded CH(M \ i)-modules
CH(M) = CH(i) ⊕



xF ∪i CH(i) .

(D1 )

F ∈Si

All pairs of distinct summands are orthogonal for the Poincaré pairing of CH(M). If i is
a coloop of M, there is a direct sum decomposition of CH(M) into indecomposable graded
CH(M \ i)-modules
CH(M) = CH(i) ⊕ xE\i CH(i) ⊕



xF ∪i CH(i) .

(D2 )

F ∈Si

All pairs of distinct summands except for the ﬁrst two are orthogonal for the Poincaré
pairing of CH(M).
The CH(M \ i)-module summands in the decompositions (D1 ) and (D2 ) admit isomorphisms
CH(i) ∼
= CH(M \ i) and xF ∪i CH(i) ∼
= CH(MF ∪i ) ⊗ CH(MF )[−1],
(Propositions 3.4 and 3.5). In addition, if i is a coloop of M,
xE\i CH(i) ∼
= CH(M \ i)[−1].

1.3. Let B be the Boolean matroid on E. By deﬁnition, every subset of E is a
ﬂat of B. The Chow rings of B and M are related by the surjective graded algebra
homomorphism
CH(B) −→ CH(M),

xS −→ xS ,

where a variable in the target is set to zero if its label is not a ﬂat of M. Similarly, we
have a surjective graded algebra homomorphism
CH(B) −→ CH(M),

xS −→ xS ,

where a variable in the target is set to zero if its label is not a ﬂat of M. As in [1, Section
4], we may identify the Chow ring CH(B) with the ring of piecewise polynomial functions
modulo linear functions on the normal fan ΠB of the standard permutohedron in RE .
Similarly, the augmented Chow ring CH(B) can be identiﬁed with the ring of piecewise
polynomial functions modulo linear functions of the normal fan ΠB of the stellahedron
in RE (Deﬁnition 2.4). A convex piecewise linear function on a complete fan is said to
be strictly convex if there is a bijection between the cones in the fan and the faces of the
graph of the function.
In Section 4, we use Theorems 1.2 and 1.5 to give simple proofs of Poincaré duality,
the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge–Riemann relations for CH(M) and CH(M).
Theorem 1.6. Let  be a strictly convex piecewise linear function on ΠB , viewed as an
element of CH1 (M).
(1) (Poincaré duality theorem) For every nonnegative integer k < d2 , the bilinear pairing
CHk (M) × CHd−k−1 (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ degM (η1 η2 )

is nondegenerate.
(2) (Hard Lefschetz theorem) For every nonnegative integer k < d2 , the multiplication
map
CHk (M) −→ CHd−k−1 (M),

η −→ d−2k−1 η

is an isomorphism.
(3) (Hodge–Riemann relations) For every nonnegative integer k < d2 , the bilinear form
CHk (M) × CHk (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ (−1)k degM (d−2k−1 η1 η2 )

is positive deﬁnite on the kernel of multiplication by d−2k .
Let  be a strictly convex piecewise linear function on ΠB , viewed as an element of
CH1 (M).

(4) (Poincaré duality theorem) For every nonnegative integer k ⩽ d2 , the bilinear pairing
CHk (M) × CHd−k (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ degM (η1 η2 )

is nondegenerate.
(5) (Hard Lefschetz theorem) For every nonnegative integer k ⩽ d2 , the multiplication
map
CHk (M) −→ CHd−k (M),

η −→ d−2k η

is an isomorphism.
(6) (Hodge–Riemann relations) For every nonnegative integer k ⩽ d2 , the bilinear form
CHk (M) × CHk (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ (−1)k degM (d−2k η1 η2 )

is positive deﬁnite on the kernel of multiplication by d−2k+1 .
Theorem 1.6 holds non-vacuously, as there are strictly convex piecewise linear functions on ΠB and ΠB (Proposition 2.6). The ﬁrst part of Theorem 1.6 on CH(M) recovers
the main result of [1].6 The second part of Theorem 1.6 on CH(M) is new.
Remark 1.7. By Remark 2.10 and Proposition 2.12, we can reformulate Theorem 1.6 as
follows: Both the Bergman fan and the augmented Bergman fan satisfy Poincaré duality,
and they satisfy the hard Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations with
respect to any strictly convex piecewise linear function.
1.4. In Section 5, we use Theorems 1.2 and 1.5 to obtain decompositions of CH(M)
and CH(M) related to those appearing in [1, Theorem 6.18]. Let Hα (M) be the subalgebra
of CH(M) generated by the element
αM :=



xG ∈ CH1 (M),

i∈G

where the sum is over all nonempty proper ﬂats G of M containing a given element i in
E, and let Hα (M) be the subalgebra of CH(M) generated by the element
αM :=



xG ∈ CH1 (M),

G

where the sum is over all proper ﬂats G of M. We deﬁne graded subspaces Jα (M) and
Jα (M) by

Independent proofs of Poincaré duality for CH(M) were given in [3] and [2]. The authors of [3] also prove
the degree 1 Hodge–Riemann relations for CH(M).

Theorem 1.8. Let Q = Q(M) be the set of all nonempty proper ﬂats of M, and let Q =
Q(M) be the set of all proper ﬂats of M with rank at least two.

Remark 1.9. The decomposition (D3 ) and the decomposition induced by [1, Theorem
6.18] are isomorphic as decompositions of graded vector spaces, but the latter one is not
an orthogonal decomposition. In each case, applying the decomposition to MF for all
F , we get a basis of CH(M) that is permuted by any automorphism of M. For example,
when M is a matroid of rank 5, the decomposition (D3 ) in degree 3 gives

In general, the basis of CH(M) given by the decomposition (D3 ) is diﬀerent from the
ones in [17, Corollary 1] and [3, Corollary 3.3.3].

1.5. For realizable matroids, the Chow ring, the augmented Chow ring, and the
Möbius algebra are indeed Chow rings (or cohomology rings when realized over C) of
certain algebraic varieties. We explain the geometric motivations of the paper in the
remaining part of the introduction.
First, we recall the deﬁnition and some relevant properties of semi-small maps. Let
f : X → Y be a map between smooth complex projective varieties. For every integer
k, we say that the map f is semi-small if there is no irreducible subvariety T ⊆ X
such that 2 dim T − dim f (T ) > dim X. For example, if f is the blowup along a smooth
center Z, then f is semi-small if and only if Z ⊆ Y is of codimension at most two.
Semi-small maps play an essential role in the proof of the decomposition theorem by
de Cataldo and Migliorini [10,11]. Using the language of the decomposition theorem, a
map f : X → Y of smooth projective varieties is semi-small if and only if the derived
pushforward Rf∗ (QX [dim X]) is a perverse sheaf on Y . If f is semi-small, then for any
ample class A in H 2 (Y ; Q), its pullback f ∗ (A) behaves like an ample class on X [10,
Propositions 2.2.7 and 2.3.1]. More precisely, the cohomology ring H • (X; Q) satisﬁes the
hard Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to f ∗ (A).
When M is realized by a hyperplane arrangement A = {Hi }i∈E in the projectivization
of a d-dimensional vector space V over a ﬁeld F , there are smooth projective varieties
XA and X A over F whose Chow rings are isomorphic to CH(M) and CH(M) respectively,
and we call them the wonderful model and the augmented wonderful model of A. The
wonderful model X A was used in [19] to prove the log-concavity of the coeﬃcients of the
characteristic polynomial of realizable matroids.

Let us recall the construction of X A . For any nonempty proper subset S ⊆ E, we set
HS =



Hi

and HS◦ = HS \

i∈S



HT .

ST

Then HS◦ is nonempty if and only if S is a nonempty proper ﬂat of M, and in this case,

the dimension of HS◦ is equal to crk(S) − 1. The divisor i∈E Hi admits a stratiﬁcation

◦
F HF , where the disjoint union is over all nonempty proper ﬂats F of M.
i∈E Hi =
To construct the wonderful model X A , we ﬁrst blow up the points HF in P (V ) for all
corank one ﬂats F , then we blow up the strict transforms of HF for corank two ﬂats
F , and so on. The resulting smooth projective variety is X A . See Remark 2.16 for an
alternative description of the wonderful model.
Denote by A \ i the hyperplane arrangement obtained from A by deleting the hyperplane Hi . Then there is regular map X A → X A\i , which models the decompositions (D1 )
and (D2 ). When i is not a coloop of M, the map is semi-small because it can be written
as a sequence of blowups of smooth subvarieties of codimension two parametrized by Si .
In fact, for any F in Si , when the strict transform of HF is blown up in the construction
of X A\i , the preimage of HF◦ ∪i is of codimension two. The wonderful model X A can be
obtained from X A\i by blowing up the closure of the preimage of HF◦ ∪i for all F in Si .
When i is a coloop, the map X A → X A\i is generically a P 1 bundle, which corresponds
to the ﬁrst two summands CH(i) and xE\i CH(i) in the decomposition (D2 ).
The decomposition (D3 ) is modeled by the composition of all the blowup maps X A →
P (V ) in the construction of X A . Moreover, the class α in CH1 (MA ) is equal to the
pullback of the hyperplane class of P (V ), via the identiﬁcation of CH(MA ) and the
Chow ring of X A . For each i in E, choose a linear form fi that deﬁnes the hyperplane
Hi . Then the rational map
1
fi i∈E

: P (V )  P (F E )

extends to a regular map X A → P (F E ). The pullback of the hyperplane class of P (F E )
is equal to the class β, which will be deﬁned in Section 2.6. The image of X A in P (F E )
is the projective reciprocal plane, which is singular in general, and its intersection cohomology groups are closely related to the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial of M (see [14]).
The decomposition of CH(M) as a module over the subalgebra Q[β] involves intersection
cohomology groups of singular projective varieties and will be studied in [4].
To construct the augmented wonderful model XA , we start with the projective space
P (V ⊕ F ) = V ∪ P (V ).
For any nonempty proper ﬂat F , we consider the previously deﬁned HF as a linear
subspace of P (V ). Similar to the construction of X A , we ﬁrst blow up all HF in P (V )
for all corank one ﬂats F , then we blow up the strict transforms of HF for all corank

two ﬂats F . We continue this process until we blow up HF for all rank one ﬂats F . Since
all the blowup centers are in the hyperplane at inﬁnity, the aﬃne space V remains an
open subset of XA . Moreover, the strict transform of the hyperplane at inﬁnity is exactly
isomorphic to X A , which explains the pullback map ϕ∅
M : CH(M) → CH(M) and the
∅
pushforward map ψM : CH(M) → CH(M).
For any i in E, there is a regular map XA → XA\i which models the decompositions
(D1 ) and (D2 ). Moreover, when i is not a coloop, the map XA → XA\i is semi-small. The
decomposition (D3 ) is modeled by the composition of all blowup maps XA → P (V ⊕ F ),
and the class α is equal to the pullback of the hyperplane class, via identifying CH(M)
with the Chow ring of XA .7 There is a natural map XA → (P 1 )E , which induces the
classes yi for i in E. In fact, the linear map
(fi )i∈E : V → F E
extends to a regular map XA → (P 1 )E . The image of the map XA → (P 1 )E is the
variety YA in [20], now called the Schubert variety of A. The operational Chow ring of
YA is isomorphic to H(M). The decomposition of CH(M) as an H(M)-module involves
the intersection cohomology groups of singular varieties, and will be studied in [4].
The decomposition theorem for proper toric maps was studied in [12], and the combinatorial generalization to fans was studied in [21]. Since the Bergman fan and the
augmented Bergman fan are not complete, our results are of a diﬀerent nature.

2. The Chow ring and the augmented Chow ring of a matroid
In this section, we collect the various properties of the algebras CH(M) and CH(M)
that we will need in order to prove Theorems 1.2–1.8. In Section 2.1, we review the
deﬁnition and basic properties of the Bergman fan and introduce the closely related
augmented Bergman fan of a matroid. Section 2.2 is devoted to understanding the stars
of the various rays in these two fans, while Section 2.3 is where we compute the space
of balanced top-dimensional weights on each fan. Feichtner and Yuzvinsky showed that
the Chow ring of a matroid coincides with the Chow ring of the toric variety associated
with its Bergman fan [17, Theorem 3], and we establish the analogous result for the
augmented Chow ring in Section 2.4. Section 2.5 is where we show that the augmented
Chow ring contains the graded Möbius algebra. In Section 2.6, we use the results of
Section 2.2 to construct various homomorphisms that relate the Chow and augmented
Chow rings of diﬀerent matroids.
7
There is no natural map from XA to P (F E ) or to P (F E ⊕ F), and hence the symbol βM will not be
deﬁned.

Remark 2.1. It is worth noting why we need to interpret CH(M) and CH(M) as Chow
rings of toric varieties. First, the study of balanced weights on the Bergman fan and
augmented Bergman fan allow us to show that CHd−1 (M) and CHd (M) are nonzero,
which is not easy to prove directly from the deﬁnitions. The deﬁnition of the pullback
and pushforward maps in Section 2.6 is made cleaner by thinking about fans, though it
would also be possible to deﬁne these maps by taking Propositions 2.20, 2.21, 2.24, 2.25,
2.28, and 2.29 as deﬁnitions. Finally, and most importantly, the fan perspective will be
essential for understanding the ample classes that appear in Theorem 1.6.
2.1. Fans
Let E be a ﬁnite set, and let M be a loopless matroid of rank d on the ground set E.
We write rkM for the rank function of M, and write clM for the closure operator of M,
which for a set S returns the smallest ﬂat containing S. The independence complex IM
of M is the simplicial complex of independent sets of M. A set I ⊆ E is independent if
and only if the rank of clM (I) is |I|. The vertices of IM are the elements of the ground
set E, and a collection of vertices is a face of IM when the corresponding set of elements
is an independent set of M. The Bergman complex ΔM of M is the order complex of the
poset of nonempty proper ﬂats of M. The vertices of ΔM are the nonempty proper ﬂats
of M, and a collection of vertices is a face of ΔM when the corresponding set of ﬂats is
a ﬂag. The independence complex of M is pure of dimension d − 1, and the Bergman
complex of M is pure of dimension d − 2. For a detailed study of the simplicial complexes
IM and ΔM , we refer to [5]. We introduce the augmented Bergman complex ΔM of M
as a simplicial complex that interpolates between the independence complex and the
Bergman complex of M.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let I be an independent set of M, and let F be a ﬂag of proper ﬂats
of M. When I is contained in every ﬂat in F, we say that I is compatible with F and
write I ⩽ F. The augmented Bergman complex ΔM of M is the simplicial complex of all
compatible pairs I ⩽ F, where I is an independent set of M and F is a ﬂag of proper
ﬂats of M.
A vertex of the augmented Bergman complex ΔM is either a singleton subset of E or
a proper ﬂat of M. More precisely, the vertices of ΔM are the compatible pairs either of
the form {i} ⩽ ∅ or of the form ∅ ⩽ {F }, where i is an element of E and F is a proper
ﬂat of M. The augmented Bergman complex contains both the independence complex IM
and the Bergman complex ΔM as subcomplexes. In fact, ΔM contains the order complex
of the poset of proper ﬂats of M, which is the cone over the Bergman complex with the
cone point corresponding to the empty ﬂat. It is straightforward to check that ΔM is
pure of dimension d − 1.

14

Proposition 2.3. The Bergman complex and the augmented Bergman complex of M are
both connected in codimension 1.
Proof. The statement about the Bergman complex is a direct consequence of its shellability [5]. We prove the statement about the augmented Bergman complex using the
statement about the Bergman complex.
The claim is that, given any two facets of ΔM , one may travel from one facet to the
other by passing through faces of codimension at most 1. Since the Bergman complex of
M is connected in codimension 1, the subcomplex of ΔM consisting of faces of the form
∅ ⩽ F is connected in codimension 1. Thus it suﬃces to show that any facet of ΔM can
be connected to a facet of the form ∅ ⩽ F through codimension 1 faces.
Let I ⩽ F be a facet of ΔM . If I is nonempty, choose any element i of I, and consider
the ﬂag of ﬂats G obtained by adjoining the closure of I \ i to F. The independent set
I \ i is compatible with the ﬂag G, and the facet I ⩽ F is adjacent to the facet I \ i ⩽ G.
Repeating the procedure, we can connect the given facet to a facet of the desired form
through codimension 1 faces. 
Let RE be the vector space spanned by the standard basis vectors ei corresponding
to the elements i ∈ E. For an arbitrary subset S ⊆ E, we set
eS :=



ei .

i∈S

For an element i ∈ E, we write ρi for the ray generated by the vector ei in RE . For
a subset S ⊆ E, we write ρS for the ray generated by the vector −eE\S in RE , and
write ρS for the image of this ray in RE / eE , which is generated by the image of eS .8
Using these rays, we construct fan models of the Bergman complex and the augmented
Bergman complex as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.4. The Bergman fan ΠM of M is a simplicial fan in the quotient space
RE / eE with rays ρF for nonempty proper ﬂats F of M. The cones of ΠM are of the
form
σ F := cone{eF }F ∈F = cone{−eE\F }F ∈F ,
where F is a ﬂag of nonempty proper ﬂats of M.
The augmented Bergman fan ΠM of M is a simplicial fan in RE with rays ρi for
elements i in E and ρF for proper ﬂats F of M. The cones of the augmented Bergman
fan are of the form
σI⩽F := cone{ei }i∈I + cone{−eE\F }F ∈F ,
8

The reason why ρS is the correct lift of ρS for our purposes will become clear in Section 2.2.

Fig. 1. The augmented Bergman fan of the rank 2 Boolean matroid on {1, 2}.

where F is a ﬂag of proper ﬂats of M and I is an independent set of M compatible with
F. We write σI for the cone σI⩽F when F is the empty ﬂag of ﬂats of M (see Fig. 1).
Remark 2.5. If E is nonempty, then the Bergman fan ΠM is the star of the ray ρ∅ in the
augmented Bergman fan ΠM . If E is empty, then ΠM and ΠM both consist of a single
0-dimensional cone.
Let N be another loopless matroid on E. The matroid M is said to be a quotient of
N if every ﬂat of M is a ﬂat of N. The condition implies that every independent set of
M is an independent set of N [22, Proposition 8.1.6]. Therefore, when M is a quotient of
N, the augmented Bergman fan of M is a subfan of the augmented Bergman fan of N,
and the Bergman fan of M is a subfan of the Bergman fan of N. In particular, we have
inclusions of fans ΠM ⊆ ΠB and ΠM ⊆ ΠB , where B is the Boolean matroid on E deﬁned
by the condition that E is an independent set of B.
Proposition 2.6. The Bergman fan and the augmented Bergman fan of B are each normal
fans of convex polytopes. In particular, there are strictly convex piecewise linear functions
on ΠB and ΠB .
The above proposition can be used to show that the augmented Bergman fan and the
Bergman fan of M are, in fact, fans.
Proof. The statement for the Bergman fan is well-known: The Bergman fan of B is the
E
normal fan of the standard permutohedron in e⊥
E ⊆ R . See, for example, [1, Section 2].

16

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

The statement for the augmented Bergman fan ΠB follows from the fact that it is an
iterated stellar subdivision of the normal fan of the simplex
conv{ei , eE }i∈E ⊆ RE .
More precisely, ΠB is isomorphic to the fan ΣP in [1, Deﬁnition 2.3], where P is the order
ﬁlter of all subsets of E ∪ 0 containing the new element 0, via the linear isomorphism
RE −→ RE∪0 / eE + e0 ,

ej −→ ej .

It is shown in [1, Proposition 2.4] that ΣP is an iterated stellar subdivision of the normal
fan of the simplex.9 
A direct inspection shows that ΠM is a unimodular fan; that is, the set of primitive
ray generators in any cone in ΠM is a subset of a basis of the free abelian group ZE . It
follows that ΠM is also a unimodular fan; that is, the set of primitive ray generators in
any cone in ΠM is a subset of a basis of the free abelian group ZE / eE .
2.2. Stars
For any element i of E, we write cl(i) for the closure of i in M, and write ιi for the
injective linear map
ιi : RE\cl(i) −→ RE / ei ,

ej −→ ej .

For any proper ﬂat F of M, we write ιF for the linear isomorphism
ιF : RE\F / eE\F

⊕ RF −→ RE / eE\F ,

ej −→ ej .

For any nonempty proper ﬂat F of M, we write ιF for the linear isomorphism
ιF : RE\F / eE\F

⊕ RF / eF −→ RE / eE , eE\F ,

ej −→ ej .

Let MF be the localization of M at F , and let MF be the contraction of M by F .
Proposition 2.7. The following are descriptions of the stars of the rays in ΠM and ΠM
using the three linear maps above.
9
In fact, the augmented Bergman fan ΠB is the normal fan of the stellahedron in RE , the graph associahedron of the star graph with |E| endpoints. We refer to [7] and [13] for detailed discussions of graph
associahedra and their realizations. An explicit description of their normal fans that motivated Deﬁnition 2.4
can be found in [15, Theorem 3.14] and [27, Theorem 7.4].

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

(1) For any element i ∈ E, the linear map ιi identiﬁes the augmented Bergman fan of
Mcl(i) with the star of the ray ρi in the augmented Bergman fan of M:
ΠMcl(i) ∼
= starρi ΠM .
(2) For any proper ﬂat F of M, the linear map ιF identiﬁes the product of the Bergman
fan of MF and the augmented Bergman fan of MF with the star of the ray ρF in the
augmented Bergman fan of M:
Π MF × Π MF ∼
= starρF ΠM .
(3) For any nonempty proper ﬂat F of M, the linear map ιF identiﬁes the product of
the Bergman fan of MF and the Bergman fan of MF with the star of the ray ρF in
the Bergman fan of M:
Π MF × Π MF ∼
= starρF ΠM .
Repeated applications of the ﬁrst statement show that, for any independent set I of
M, the star of the cone σI in ΠM can be identiﬁed with the augmented Bergman fan of
Mcl(I) , where cl(I) is the closure of I in M.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from the following facts: A ﬂat of M contains i if
and only if it contains cl(i), and an independent set of M containing i does not contain
any other element in cl(i). The second and third statements follow directly from the
deﬁnitions. 
2.3. Weights
For any simplicial fan Σ, we write Σk for the set of k-dimensional cones in Σ. If τ is
a codimension 1 face of a cone σ, we write
eσ/τ := the primitive generator of the unique ray in σ that is not in τ .
A k-dimensional balanced weight on Σ is a Q-valued function ω on Σk that satisﬁes the
balancing condition: For every (k − 1)-dimensional cone τ in Σ,


ω(σ)eσ/τ is contained in the subspace spanned by τ ,

τ ⊂σ

where the sum is over all k-dimensional cones σ containing τ . We write MWk (Σ) for the
group of k-dimensional balanced weights on Σ.
Proposition 2.8. The Bergman fan and the augmented Bergman fan of M have the following unique balancing property.

18

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

(1) A (d − 1)-dimensional weight on ΠM is balanced if and only if it is constant.
(2) A d-dimensional weight on ΠM is balanced if and only if it is constant.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is [1, Proposition 5.2]. We prove the second statement.
Let σI⩽F be a codimension 1 cone of ΠM , and let F be the smallest ﬂat in F ∪ {E}.
We analyze the primitive generators of the rays in the star of the cone σI⩽F in ΠM . Let
cl(I) be the closure of I in M. There are two cases.
When the closure of I is not F , the primitive ray generators in question are −eE\cl(I)
and ei , for elements i in F not in the closure of I. The primitive ray generators satisfy
the relation
−eE\cl(I) +



ei = −eE\F ,

i∈F \cl(I)

which is zero modulo the span of σI⩽F . As the ei ’s are independent modulo the span of
σI⩽F , any relation between the primitive generators must be a multiple of the displayed
one.
When the closure of I is F , the fact that σI⩽F has codimension 1 implies that there
is a unique integer k with rk F < k < rk M such that F does not include a ﬂat of rank
k. Let F◦ be the unique ﬂat in F of rank k − 1, and let F ◦ be the unique ﬂat in F ∪ {E}
of rank k + 1. The primitive ray generators in question are −eE\G for the ﬂats G in G,
where G is the set of ﬂats of M covering F◦ and covered by F ◦ . By the ﬂat partition
property of matroids [25, Section 1.4], the primitive ray generators satisfy the relation


−eE\G = −(|G| − 1)eE\F◦ − eE\F ◦ ,

G∈G

which is zero modulo the span of σI⩽F . Since any proper subset of the primitive generators −eE\G for G in G is independent modulo the span of σI⩽F , any relation between
the primitive generators must be a multiple of the displayed one.
The local analysis above shows that any constant d-dimensional weight on ΠM is
balanced. Since ΠM is connected in codimension 1 by Proposition 2.3, it also shows that
any d-dimensional balanced weight on ΠM must be constant. 
Remark 2.9. The deﬁnition of Bergman fan and augmented Bergman fan generalizes
to any atomic lattice. The above balancing condition is equivalent to the ﬂat partition
property: For any ﬂat F , any element in E \ F is contained in exactly one ﬂat that is
minimal among the ﬂats strictly containing F .
2.4. Chow rings
Any unimodular fan Σ in RE deﬁnes a graded commutative algebra CH(Σ), which is
the Chow ring of the associated smooth toric variety XΣ over C with rational coeﬃcients.

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

19

Equivalently, CH(Σ) is the ring of continuous piecewise polynomial functions on Σ with
rational coeﬃcients modulo the ideal generated by globally linear functions [6, Section
3.1]. We write CHk (Σ) for the Chow group of codimension k cycles in XΣ , so that
CH(Σ) =



CHk (Σ).

k

The group of k-dimensional balanced weights on Σ is related to CHk (Σ) by the isomorphism
MWk (Σ) −→ HomQ (CHk (Σ), Q),

ω −→ (xσ −→ ω(σ)),

where xσ is the class of the torus orbit closure in XΣ corresponding to a k-dimensional
cone σ in Σ. See [1, Section 5] for a detailed discussion. For general facts on toric varieties
and Chow rings, and for any undeﬁned terms, we refer to [9] and [16].
Remark 2.10. For any simplicial fan Σ, we will say that Σ satisﬁes the hard Lefschetz
theorem or the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to some piecewise linear function
on Σ if the ring CH(Σ) satisﬁes the hard Lefschetz theorem or the Hodge–Riemann
relations with respect to the corresponding element of CH1 (Σ).
In Proposition 2.12 below, we show that the Chow ring of M coincides with CH(ΠM )
and that the augmented Chow ring of M coincides with CH(ΠM ).
Lemma 2.11. The following identities hold in the augmented Chow ring CH(M).
(1) For any element i of E, we have yi2 = 0.


(2) For any two bases I1 and I2 of a ﬂat F of M, we have i∈I1 yi = i∈I2 yi .

(3) For any dependent set J of M, we have j∈J yj = 0.
Proof. The ﬁrst identity is a straightforward consequence of the relations in IM and JM :
yi2 = yi

For the second identity, we may assume that I1 \ I2 = {i1 } and I2 \ I1 = {i2 }, by
the basis exchange property of matroids and an induction on the size of the symmetric
diﬀerence between I1 and I2 . Since a ﬂat of M contains I1 if and only if it contains I2 ,
we have

For the third identity, we may suppose that J is a circuit, that is, a minimal dependent
set. Since M is a loopless matroid, we may choose distinct elements j1 and j2 from J.
Note that the independent sets J \ j1 and J \ j2 have the same closure because J is a
circuit. Therefore, by the second identity, we have




yj =

j∈J\j1

yj .

yF :=



yi in CH(M)

i∈I

for any ﬂat F of M and any basis I of F . The element yE will play the role of the
fundamental class for the augmented Chow ring of M.
Proposition 2.12. We have isomorphisms
CH(M) ∼
= CH(ΠM )

and

CH(M) ∼
= CH(ΠM ).

Proof. The ﬁrst isomorphism is proved in [17, Theorem 3]; see also [1, Section 5.3].

Let KM be the ideal of SM generated by the monomials j∈J yj for every dependent
set J of M. The ring of continuous piecewise polynomial functions on ΠM is isomorphic
to the Stanley–Reisner ring of ΔM , which is equal to
SM /(JM + KM ).
The ring CH(ΠM ) is obtained from this ring by killing the linear forms that generate the
ideal IM . In other words, we have a surjective homomorphism

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

21

CH(M) := SM /(IM + JM ) −→ SM /(IM + JM + KM ) ∼
= CH(ΠM ).
The fact that this is an isomorphism follows from the third part of Lemma 2.11. 
Remark 2.13. By Proposition 2.12, the graded dimension of the Chow ring of the rank d
Boolean matroid CH(B) is given by the h-vector of the permutohedron in RE . In other
words, we have
dim CHk (B) = the Eulerian number

 
d
.
k

See [26, Section 9.1] for more on permutohedra and Eulerian numbers.
Remark 2.14. If E is nonempty, we have the balanced weight
1 ∈ MWd−1 (ΠM ) ∼
= HomQ (CHd−1 (M), Q),
which can be used to deﬁne a degree map on the Chow ring of M. Similarly, for any E,
1 ∈ MWd (ΠM ) ∼
= HomQ (CHd (M), Q)
can be used to deﬁne a degree map on the augmented Chow ring of M.
Deﬁnition 2.15. Consider the following degree maps for the Chow ring and the augmented
Chow ring of M.
(1) If E is nonempty, the degree map for CH(M) is the linear map
degM : CHd−1 (M) −→ Q,

xF −→ 1,

where xF is any monomial corresponding to a maximal cone σF of ΠM .
(2) For any E, the degree map for CH(M) is the linear map
degM : CHd (M) −→ Q,

xI⩽F −→ 1,

where xI⩽F is any monomial corresponding to a maximal cone σI⩽F of ΠM .
By Proposition 2.8, the degree maps are well-deﬁned and are isomorphisms. It follows
that, for any two maximal cones σ F1 and σ F2 of the Bergman fan of M,
xF1 = xF2 in CHd−1 (M).
Similarly, for any two maximal cones σI1 ⩽F1 and σI2 ⩽F2 of the augmented Bergman fan
of M,

22

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

yF1 xF1 = yF2 xF2 in CHd (M),
where F1 is the closure of I1 in M and F2 is the closure of I2 in M. Proposition 2.12
shows that
CHk (M) = 0 for k ⩾ d and CHk (M) = 0 for k > d.
Remark 2.16. Let F be a ﬁeld, and let V be a d-dimensional linear subspace of F E . We
suppose that the subspace V is not contained in F S ⊆ F E for any proper subset S of E.
Let B be the Boolean matroid on E, and let M be the loopless matroid on E deﬁned by
S is an independent set of M ⇐⇒ the restriction to V of the projection F E → F S is surjective.

Let P (F E ) be the projective space of lines in F E , and let T E be its open torus. For any
proper ﬂat F of M, we write HF for the projective subspace


HF := p ∈ P (V )|pi = 0 for all i ∈ F .
The wonderful variety X V is obtained from P (V ) by ﬁrst blowing up HF for every corank
1 ﬂat F , then blowing up the strict transforms of HF for every corank 2 ﬂat F , and so
on. Equivalently,
X V = the closure of P (V ) ∩ T E in the toric variety X M deﬁned by ΠM
= the closure of P (V ) ∩ T E in the toric variety X B deﬁned by ΠB .
When E is nonempty, the inclusion X V ⊆ X M induces an isomorphism between their
Chow rings,10 and hence the Chow ring of X V is isomorphic to CH(M) [17, Corollary 2].
Let P (F E ⊕ F ) be the projective completion of F E , and let TE be its open torus. The
projective completion P (V ⊕ F ) contains a copy of P (V ) as the hyperplane at inﬁnity,
and it therefore contains a copy of HF for every nonempty proper ﬂat F . The augmented
wonderful variety XV is obtained from P (V ⊕ F 1 ) by ﬁrst blowing up HF for every
corank 1 ﬂat F , then blowing up the strict transforms of HF for every corank 2 ﬂat F ,
and so on. Equivalently,
XV = the closure of P (V ⊕ F ) ∩ TE in the toric variety XM deﬁned by ΠM
= the closure of P (V ⊕ F ) ∩ TE in the toric variety XB deﬁned by ΠB .
The inclusion XV ⊆ XM induces an isomorphism between their Chow rings, and hence
the Chow ring of XV is isomorphic to CH(M).11
10
In general, the inclusion X V ⊆ X M does not induce an isomorphism between their singular cohomology
rings.
11
This can be proved using the interpretation of CH(M) in the last sentence of Remark 4.1.

2.5. The graded Möbius algebra
For any nonnegative integer k, we deﬁne a vector space


Hk (M) :=

Q yF ,

F ∈Lk (M)

where the direct sum is over the set Lk (M) of rank k ﬂats of M.
Deﬁnition 2.17. The graded Möbius algebra of M is the graded vector space
H(M) :=



Hk (M).

k⩾0

The multiplication in H(M) is deﬁned by the rule

yF1 yF2 =

yF1 ∨F2

if rkM (F1 ) + rkM (F2 ) = rkM (F1 ∨ F2 ),

0

if rkM (F1 ) + rkM (F2 ) > rkM (F1 ∨ F2 ),

where ∨ stands for the join operation in the lattice of ﬂats L(M) of M.
Our double use of the symbol yF is justiﬁed by the following proposition, whose proof
is essentially identical to that of [20, Proposition 9].
Proposition 2.18. The graded linear map
H(M) −→ CH(M),

yF −→ yF

is an injective homomorphism of graded algebras.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that the linear map is injective. It is enough to check that the
subset
{yF }F ∈Lk (M) ⊆ CHk (M)
is linearly independent for every nonnegative integer k < d. Suppose that


cF yF = 0 for some cF ∈ Q.

F ∈Lk (M)

For any given rank k ﬂat G, we choose a saturated ﬂag of proper ﬂats G whose smallest
member is G. By the deﬁning relations of CH(M), we have yF xG = 0 for any rank k ﬂat
F other than G, therefore



cG yG xG =

cF yF xG = 0.

F ∈Lk (M)

Since the degree of yG xG is 1, this implies that cG must be zero.
We next check that the linear map is an algebra homomorphism using Lemma 2.11.
Let I1 be a basis of a ﬂat F1 , and let I2 be a basis of a ﬂat F2 . If the rank of F1 ∨ F2 is
the sum of the ranks of F1 and F2 , then I1 and I2 are disjoint and their union is a basis
of F1 ∨ F2 . Therefore, in the augmented Chow ring of M,
yF1 yF2 =



yi

i∈I1



yi =



yi = yF1 ∨F2 .

i∈I1 ∪I2

i∈I2

If the rank of F1 ∨ F2 is less than the sum of the ranks of F1 and F2 , then either I1 and
I2 intersect or the union of I1 and I2 is dependent in M. Therefore, in the augmented
Chow ring of M,
yF1 yF2 =



yi = 0. 

Remark 2.19. Consider the torus TE , the toric variety XB , and the augmented wonderful
variety XV in Remark 2.16. The identity of TE uniquely extends to a toric map
pB : XB −→ (P 1 )E .
Let pV be the restriction of pB to the augmented wonderful variety XV . If we identify
the Chow ring of XV with CH(M) as in Remark 2.16, the image of the pullback p∗V is
the graded Möbius algebra H(M) ⊆ CH(M).
2.6. Pullback and pushforward maps
Let Σ be a unimodular fan, and let σ be a k-dimensional cone in Σ. The torus orbit
closure in the smooth toric variety XΣ corresponding to σ can be identiﬁed with the toric
variety of the fan starσ Σ. Its class in the Chow ring of XΣ is the monomial xσ , which
is the product of the divisor classes xρ corresponding to the rays ρ in σ. The inclusion ι
of the torus orbit closure in XΣ deﬁnes the pullback ι∗ and the pushforward ι∗ between
the Chow rings, whose composition is multiplication by the monomial xσ :

The pullback ι∗ is a surjective graded algebra homomorphism, while the pushforward ι∗

We give an explicit description of the pullback ι∗ and the pushforward ι∗ when Σ is
the augmented Bergman fan ΠM and σ is the ray ρF of a proper ﬂat F of M. Recall
from Proposition 2.7 that the star of ρF admits the decomposition
starρF ΠM ∼
= ΠMF × ΠMF .
Thus we may identify the Chow ring of the star of ρF with CH(MF ) ⊗ CH(MF ). We
denote the pullback to the tensor product by ϕF
M and the pushforward from the tensor

To describe the pullback and the pushforward, we introduce Chow classes αM , αM , and
β M . They are deﬁned as the sums
αM :=



xG ∈ CH1 (M),

G

where the sum is over all proper ﬂats G of M;
αM :=



xG ∈ CH1 (M),

i∈G

where the sum is over all nonempty proper ﬂats G of M containing a given element i in
E; and
β M :=



xG ∈ CH1 (M),

i∈G
/

where the sum is over all nonempty proper ﬂats G of M not containing a given element
i in E. The linear relations deﬁning CH(M) show that αM and β M do not depend on the
choice of i.
Proposition 2.20. The pullback ϕF
M is the unique graded algebra homomorphism
CH(M) −→ CH(MF ) ⊗ CH(MF )
that satisﬁes the following properties:
• If G is a proper ﬂat of M incomparable to F , then ϕF
M (xG ) = 0.
• If G is a proper ﬂat of M properly contained in F , then ϕF
M (xG ) = 1 ⊗ xG .

F
• If i is an element of F , then ϕM (yi ) = 1 ⊗ yi .

Moreover, the above ﬁve properties imply the following additional properties of ϕF
M:
• The equality ϕF
M (xF ) = −1 ⊗ αMF − β MF ⊗ 1 holds.
• The equality ϕF

varieties. To show the last two properties, we ﬁx an element i ∈ E \ F . Recall that

3. Proofs of the semi-small decompositions and the Poincaré duality theorems
In this section, we prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.5 together with the two Poincaré duality
statements in Theorem 1.6. For an element i of E, we write πi and π i for the coordinate
projections
πi : RE −→ RE\i and π i : RE / eE −→ RE\i / eE\i .
Note that πi (ρi ) = 0 and π i (ρ{i} ) = 0. In addition, πi (ρS ) = ρS\i and π i (ρS ) = ρS\i
for S ⊆ E. Here we recall from Deﬁnition 2.4 that ρi and ρS denote the rays generated
by the vectors ei and −eE\S in RE , respectively, and ρS denotes the image of ρS in
RE / eE .
Proposition 3.1. Let M be a loopless matroid on E, and let i be an element of E.
(1) The projection πi maps any cone of ΠM onto a cone of ΠM\i .
(2) The projection π i maps any cone of ΠM onto a cone of ΠM\i .
Recall that a linear map deﬁnes a morphism of fans Σ1 → Σ2 if it maps any cone
of Σ1 into a cone of Σ2 [9, Chapter 3]. Thus the above proposition is stronger than the
statement that πi and π i induce morphisms of fans.
Proof of Proposition 3.1. The projection πi maps σI⩽F onto σI\i⩽F\i , where F \ i is the
ﬂag of ﬂats of M \ i obtained by removing i from the members of F. Similarly, π i maps
σ F onto σ F\i . 
By Proposition 3.1, the projection πi deﬁnes a map from the toric variety XM of ΠM
to the toric variety XM\i of ΠM\i , and hence the pullback homomorphism CH(M \ i) →
CH(M). Explicitly, the pullback is the graded algebra homomorphism
θi = θiM : CH(M \ i) −→ CH(M),

xF −→ xF + xF ∪i ,

where a variable in the target is replaced with zero if its label is not a ﬂat of M. Similarly,
π i deﬁnes a map from the toric variety X M of ΠM to the toric variety X M\i of ΠM\i ,
and hence an algebra homomorphism
θi = θM
i : CH(M \ i) −→ CH(M),

xF −→ xF + xF ∪i ,

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

32

where a variable in the target is set to zero if its label is not a ﬂat of M.
Remark 3.2. We use the notations introduced in Remark 2.16. Let V \i be the image of V
under the i-th projection F E → F E\i . We have the commutative diagrams of wonderful
varieties and their Chow rings

The map pVi is birational if and only if i is not a coloop of M. By Proposition 3.1, the
ﬁbers of pB
are at most one-dimensional, and hence the ﬁbers of pVi are at most onei
dimensional. It follows that pVi is semi-small in the sense of Goresky–MacPherson when
i is not a coloop of M.
Similarly, we have the diagrams of augmented wonderful varieties and their Chow
rings

The map pVi is birational if and only if i is not a coloop of M. By Proposition 3.1, the
V
ﬁbers of pB
i are at most one-dimensional, and hence pi is semi-small when i is not a
coloop of M.
Numerically, the semi-smallness of pVi is reﬂected in the identity
k−1
d−k−2
dim xF ∪i CH(i)
= dim xF ∪i CH(i)
.

Similarly, the semi-smallness of pVi is reﬂected in the identity13
d−k−1
dim xF ∪i CHk−1
.
(i) = dim xF ∪i CH(i)

For a detailed discussion of semi-small maps in the context of Hodge theory and the
decomposition theorem, see [10] and [11].
We show that the pullbacks θi and θi are compatible with the degree maps of M and
M \ i.
13

The displayed identities follow from Proposition 3.5 and the Poincaré duality parts of Theorem 1.6.

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

33

Lemma 3.3. Suppose that E \ i is nonempty.
(1) If i is not a coloop of M, then θi commutes with the degree maps:
degM\i = degM ◦ θi .
(2) If i is not a coloop of M, then θi commutes with the degree maps:
degM\i = degM ◦ θi .
(3) If i is a coloop of M, we have
degM\i = degM ◦ xE\i ◦ θi = degM ◦ αM ◦ θi ,
where the middle maps are multiplications by the elements xE\i and αM .
(4) If i is a coloop of M, we have
degM\i = degM ◦ xE\i ◦ θi = degM ◦ αM ◦ θi ,
where the middle maps are multiplications by the elements xE\i and αM .
Proof. If i is not a coloop of M, we may choose a basis B of M \ i that is also a basis
of M. By Proposition 2.8 and Remark 2.14, the top degree components CHd (M \ i) and
CHd (M) are both one-dimensional, so we have
CHd (M \ i) = span(yB ) and CHd (M) = span(yB ).
Since θi (yj ) = yj for all j, the ﬁrst identity follows. Similarly, by Proposition 2.32,
d−1
CHd−1 (M \ i) = span(αd−1
(M) = span(αd−1
M ).
M\i ) and CH

Since θi (αM\i ) = αM when i is not a coloop, the second identity follows.
Suppose now that i is a coloop of M. In this case, E \ i is a ﬂat and M \ i = ME\i .
Hence
E\i

E\i
ϕM ◦ θi = identity of CH(M \ i) and ϕM
◦ θi = identity of CH(M \ i).
E\i

Using the compatibility of the pushforward ψM
E\i

E\i

with the degree maps, we have
E\i

degM\i = degM ◦ ψM = degM ◦ ψM ◦ ϕM ◦ θi = degM ◦ xE\i ◦ θi .
Since θi (αM\i ) = αM − xE\i , when i is a coloop of M, the above implies


degM\i = degM ◦ xE\i ◦ θi = degM ◦ αM − θi (αM\i ) ◦ θi = degM ◦ αM ◦ θi ,

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

34

where the last equality follows from the fact that the images of θi have degree at most
d − 1. The identities for degM\i can be obtained in a similar way. 
Proposition 3.4. If CH(M \ i) satisﬁes the Poincaré duality part of Theorem 1.6, then θi
is injective. Also, if CH(M \ i) satisﬁes the Poincaré duality part of Theorem 1.6, then
θi is injective.
Proof. The proof is essentially identical to that of Proposition 2.23. 
For a ﬂat F in Si , we write θiF ∪i for the pullback map between the augmented Chow
rings obtained from the deletion of i from the localization MF ∪i :
θiF ∪i : CH(MF ) → CH(MF ∪i ).

Remark 3.6. Assuming Poincaré duality for all of our Chow rings, Propositions 2.23,
2.27, and 3.4 imply that
xF ∪i CH(i) ∼
= CH(MF ∪i ) ⊗ CH(MF )[−1] and xF ∪i CH(i) ∼

fact that ϕM ◦ θi and ϕM ◦ θi are the identity maps when i is a coloop.

It follows, assuming Poincaré duality for the Chow rings, that the restriction of the

of the desired equality. 
Lemma 3.9. If ﬂats F1 , F2 are in Si and F1 is a proper subset of F2 , then
xF1 ∪i xF2 ∪i ∈ xF1 ∪i CH(i) .
Similarly, if F1 , F2 are in Si and F1 is a proper subset of F2 , then

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

37

xF1 ∪i xF2 ∪i ∈ xF1 ∪i CH(i) .
Proof. Since F1 ∪ i is not comparable to F2 , we have
xF1 ∪i xF2 ∪i = xF1 ∪i (xF2 + xF2 ∪i ) = xF1 ∪i θi (xF2 ).
The second part follows from the same argument. 
Proof of Theorem 1.2, Theorem 1.5, and parts (1) and (4) of Theorem 1.6. All the summands in the proposed decompositions are cyclic, and therefore indecomposable in the
category of graded modules.14 We prove the decompositions by induction on the cardinality of the ground set E. If E is empty, then Theorem 1.2, Theorem 1.5, and part (1)
of Theorem 1.6 are vacuous, while part (4) of Theorem 1.6 is trivial. Furthermore, all of
these results are trivial when E is a singleton. Thus, we may assume that i is an element
of E, that E \ i is nonempty, and that all the results hold for loopless matroids whose
ground set is a proper subset of E.
First we assume that i is not a coloop. Let us show that the terms in the right-hand
side of the decomposition (D1 ) are orthogonal. Multiplying CH(i) and xF ∪i CH(i) lands
in xF ∪i CH(i) , and this ideal vanishes in degree d by Remark 3.7, so they are orthogonal.
On the other hand, the product of xF1 ∪i CH(i) and xF2 ∪i CH(i) vanishes if F1 , F2 ∈ Si are
not comparable, while if F1 < F2 or F2 < F1 , the product is contained in xF1 ∪i CH(i) or
xF2 ∪i CH(i) respectively, by Lemma 3.9. So these terms are also orthogonal.
It follows from the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.3 that the restriction of the
Poincaré pairing of CH(M) to CH(i) is nondegenerate. By Proposition 3.5, Proposition 3.8, and the induction hypothesis, the restriction of the Poincaré pairing of CH(M)
to any other summand xF ∪i CH(i) is also nondegenerate. Therefore, we can conclude that
the sum on the right-hand side of (D1 ) is a direct sum with a nondegenerate Poincaré
pairing.
To complete the proof of the decomposition (D1 ) and the Poincaré duality theorem
for CH(M), we must show that the direct sum
CH(i) ⊕



xF ∪i CH(i)

F ∈Si

is equal to all of CH(M). This is obvious in degree 0. To see that it holds in degree 1, it
is enough to check that xG is contained in the direct sum for any proper ﬂat G of M. If
G\i ∈
/ Si , then xG = θi (xG\i ) is in CH(i) . If G \ i ∈ Si , then either i ∈ G or i ∈
/ G. In
the ﬁrst case, xG = x(G\i)∪i is an element of the summand indexed by F = G \ i. In the
second case, we have xG = θi (xG ) − xG∪i , which lies in CH(i) + xG∪i CH(i) .
14
By [8, Corollary 2] or [18, Theorem 3.2], the indecomposability of the summands in the category of
graded modules implies the indecomposability of the summands in the category of modules.

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

38

Since our direct sum is a sum of CH(M \ i)-modules and it includes the degree 0 and
1 parts of CH(M), it will suﬃce to show that CH(M) is generated in degrees 0 and 1 as
a graded CH(M \ i)-module. In other words, we need to show that
CH1(i) · CHk (M) = CHk+1 (M) for any k ⩾ 1.
We ﬁrst prove the equality when k = 1. Since we have proved that the decomposition
(D1 ) holds in degree 1, we know that

Using Lemma 3.9, we may reduce the problem to showing that

0 = (θi (xF ) − xF ∪i )

thus reducing the problem to showing that
xF xG ∈ CH1(i) · CH1 (M) for any G < F ∈ Si .
The collection Si is downward closed, meaning that if G < F ∈ Si , then G ∈ Si ; therefore,
xF xG = (θi (xF ) − xF ∪i )(θi (xG ) − xG∪i ).
Lemma 3.9 tells us that xF ∪i xG∪i ∈ CH1(i) · CH1 (M), thus so is xF xG .
We next prove the equality when k ≥ 2. In this case, we use the result for k = 1 along
with the fact that the algebra CH(M) is generated in degree 1 to conclude that
CH1(i) · CHk (M) = CH1(i) · CH1 (M) · CHk−1 (M) = CH2 (M) · CHk−1 (M) = CHk+1 (M).
This completes the proof of the decomposition (D1 ) and the Poincaré duality theorem
for CH(M) when there is an element i that is not a coloop of M.

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

39

The proof when i is a coloop is almost the same; we explain the places where something
diﬀerent must be said. The orthogonality of xE\i CH(i) and xF ∪i CH(i) for F ∈ Si follows
because E \ i and F ∪ i are incomparable. To show that the right-hand side of (D2 ) spans
CH(M), one extra statement we need to check is that
x2E\i ∈ CH1(i) · CH1 (M).
Since i is a coloop, Si is the set of all ﬂats properly contained in E \ i, and we have
0 = xE\i yi =

xF xE\i = x2E\i +

where the last equality follows because E \ i and F ∪ i are not comparable. Thus
x2E\i = −



xE\i θi (xF ) ∈ CH1(i) · CH1 (M).

F ∈Si

By the induction hypothesis, we know CH(M\i) satisﬁes the Poincaré duality theorem.
By the coloop case of Lemma 3.3, the Poincaré pairing on CH(M) restricts to a perfect
pairing between CH(i) and xE\i CH(i) . Since CH(i) is a subring of CH(M) and is zero in
degree d, the restriction of the Poincaré pairing on CH(M) to CH(i) is zero. Therefore,
the subspaces CH(i) and xE\i CH(i) intersect trivially, and the restriction of the Poincaré
pairing on CH(M) to CH(i) ⊕ xE\i CH(i) is nondegenerate. This completes the proof of
the theorems about CH(M) when i is a coloop.
Now, we show the statements about the decomposition (D1 ). By an argument identical
to the one used for (D1 ), we know that the sum on the right-hand side of (D1 ) is a direct
sum with a nondegenerate Poincaré pairing. Next, we observe that the surjectivity of
the pullback ϕ∅
M gives the equality
CH1(i) · CHk (M) = CHk+1 (M) for any k ⩾ 1.
Thus, the direct sum decomposition (D1 ) and the Poincaré duality theorem for CH(M)
follow when i is not a coloop. When i is a coloop, we can prove (D2 ) and the Poincaré duality theorem by making the same adjustments as the ones in the proof about CH(M). 
4. Proofs of the hard Lefschetz theorems and the Hodge–Riemann relations
In this section, we prove Theorem 1.6. Parts (1) and (4) have already been proved in
the previous section. We will ﬁrst prove parts (2) and (3) by induction on the cardinality
of E. The proof of parts (5) and (6) is nearly identical to the proof of parts (2) and (3),
with the added nuance that we use parts (2) and (3) for the matroid M in the proof of
parts (5) and (6) for the matroid M.

40

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

Proof of Theorem 1.6, parts (2) and (3). The statements are trivial when the cardinality of E is 0 or 1, so we will assume throughout the proof that the cardinality of E is at
least 2.
Let B be the Boolean matroid on E. By the induction hypothesis, we know that for
every nonempty proper ﬂat F of M, the fans ΠMF and ΠMF satisfy the hard Lefschetz
theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to any strictly convex piecewise
linear functions on ΠBF and ΠBF , respectively. By [1, Proposition 7.7], this implies that
for every nonempty proper ﬂat F of M, the product ΠMF × ΠMF satisﬁes the hard
Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to any strictly convex
piecewise linear function on ΠBF × ΠBF . In other words, ΠM satisﬁes the local Hodge–
Riemann relations [1, Deﬁnition 7.14]:
The star of any ray in ΠM satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations.
This in turn implies that ΠM satisﬁes the hard Lefschetz theorem with respect to any
strictly convex piecewise linear function on ΠB [1, Proposition 7.15]. It remains to prove
only that ΠM satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to any strictly convex
piecewise linear function on ΠB .
Let  be a piecewise linear function on ΠB , and let HRk (M) be the Hodge–Riemann
form
HRk (M) : CHk (M) × CHk (M) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ (−1)k degM (d−2k−1 η1 η2 ).

By [1, Proposition 7.6], the fan ΠM satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect
to  if and only if, for all k < d2 , the Hodge–Riemann form HRk (M) is nondegenerate
and has the signature
k

(−1)k−j dim CHj (M) − dim CHj−1 (M) .
j=0

Since ΠM satisﬁes the hard Lefschetz theorem with respect to any strictly convex piecewise linear function on ΠB and signature is a locally constant function on the space of
nonsingular forms, the following statements are equivalent:
(i) The fan ΠM satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to any strictly convex piecewise linear function on ΠB .
(ii) The fan ΠM satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to some strictly
convex piecewise linear function on ΠB .
Furthermore, since satisfying the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to a given piecewise linear function is an open condition on the function, statement (ii) is equivalent to
the following:

T. Braden et al. / Advances in Mathematics 409 (2022) 108646

41

(iii) The fan ΠM satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to some convex
piecewise linear function on ΠB .
We show that statement (iii) holds using the semi-small decomposition in Theorem 1.2.15
If M is the Boolean matroid B, then CH(M) can be identiﬁed with the cohomology ring
of the smooth complex projective toric variety XΠB . Therefore, in this case, Theorem 1.6
is a special case of the usual hard Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations
for smooth complex projective varieties.16
If M is not the Boolean matroid B, then it has some element i ∈ E that is not a
coloop. Consider the morphism of fans
π i : ΠM −→ ΠM\i .
By induction, we know that ΠM\i satisﬁes the Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to
any strictly convex piecewise linear function  on ΠB\i . We will show that ΠM satisﬁes the
Hodge–Riemann relations with respect to the pullback i :=  ◦ πi , which is a piecewise
linear function on ΠB that is convex but not necessarily strictly convex.
By Theorem 1.2, we have the orthogonal decomposition of CH(M) into CH(M \ i)modules
CH(M) = CH(i) ⊕



xF ∪i CH(i) .

F ∈Si

By orthogonality, it is enough to show that each summand of CH(M) satisﬁes the Hodge–
Riemann relations with respect to i :
(iv) For every nonnegative integer k < d2 , the bilinear form
CHk(i) × CHk(i) −→ Q,

(η1 , η2 ) −→ (−1)k degM (id−2k−1 η1 η2 )

By Proposition 3.4, the homomorphism θi restricts to an isomorphism of CH(M \ i)modules
15
This inductive paradigm of [1] goes back to [23], where it was used to prove the hard Lefschetz theorem
for simple polytopes.
16
It is not diﬃcult to directly prove the hard Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations for
CH(B) using the coloop case of Theorem 1.2. Alternatively, we may apply McMullen’s hard Lefschetz
theorem and Hodge–Riemann relations for polytope algebras [23] to the standard permutohedron in RE .

Note that the pullback of a strictly convex piecewise linear function on ΠB\i to the star
Π(B\i)F × Π(B\i)F = ΠBF ∪i × ΠBF
is the class of a strictly convex piecewise linear function. Therefore, statement (v) follows
from Proposition 3.8 and the induction applied to MF ∪i and MF . 
Proof of Theorem 1.6, parts (5) and (6). This proof is nearly identical to the proof of
parts (2) and (3). In that argument, we used the fact that rays of ΠM are indexed by
nonempty proper ﬂats of M and the star of the ray ρF is isomorphic to ΠMF ×ΠMF , which
we can show satisﬁes the hard Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations using
the induction hypothesis. When dealing instead with the augmented Bergman fan ΠM ,
we have rays indexed by elements of E and rays indexed by proper ﬂats of M, with
starρi ΠM ∼
= ΠMcl(i)

and

starρF ΠM ∼
= Π MF × Π MF .

Thus the stars of ρi and ρF for nonempty F can be shown to satisfy the hard Lefschetz
theorem and the Hodge–Riemann relations using the induction hypothesis. However, the
star of ρ∅ is isomorphic to ΠM , so we need to use parts (2) and (3) of Theorem 1.6 for
M itself. 
Remark 4.1. It is possible to deduce Poincaré duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and
the Hodge–Riemann relations for CH(M) using [1, Theorem 6.19 and Theorem 8.8], where
the three properties are proved for generalized Bergman fans ΣN,P in [1, Deﬁnition 3.2].
We sketch the argument here, leaving details to the interested readers. Consider the
direct sum M ⊕ 0 of M and the rank 1 matroid on the singleton {0} and the order ﬁlter
P(M) of all proper ﬂats of M ⊕ 0 that contain 0. The symbols B ⊕ 0 and P(B) are deﬁned
in the same way for the Boolean matroid B on E. It is straightforward to check that the
linear isomorphism
RE −→ RE∪0 / eE + e0 ,

ej −→ ej

identiﬁes the complete fan ΠB with the complete fan ΣB ⊕ 0,P(B) , and the augmented
Bergman fan ΠM with a subfan of ΣM ⊕ 0,P(M) . The third identity in Lemma 2.11 shows
that the inclusion of the augmented Bergman fan ΠM into the generalized Bergman fan
ΣM ⊕ 0,P(M) induces an isomorphism between their Chow rings.

5. Proof of Theorem 1.8
In this section, we prove the decomposition (D3 ) by induction on the cardinality of E.
The decomposition (D3 ) can be proved using the same argument. The results are trivial
when E has at most one element. Thus, we may assume that i is an element of E, that
E \ i is nonempty, and that all the results hold for loopless matroids whose ground set
is a proper subset of E.
We ﬁrst prove that the summands appearing in the right-hand side of (D3 ) are orthogonal to each other.
Lemma 5.1. Let F and G be distinct nonempty proper ﬂats of M.
(1) The spaces ψ F
CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ) and Hα (M) are orthogonal in CH(M).
M
(2) The spaces ψ F
CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ) and ψ G
CH(MG ) ⊗ Jα (MG ) are orthogonal in
M
M
CH(M).
Proof. The ﬁfth bullet point in Proposition 2.24, together with the fact that ψ F
M
is a CH(M)-module homomorphism via ϕF
(Proposition 2.25), implies that both
M
ψF
CH(MF ) ⊗Jα (MF ) and Hα (M) are Hα (M)-submodules of CH(M). Thus, the product
M
of μ ∈ ψ F
CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ) and ν ∈ Hα (M) of complimentary degree lands in the
M
degree d − 1 component of ψ F
CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ), which is zero. The ﬁrst orthogonality
M
follows.
For the second orthogonality, we may suppose that F is a proper subset of G. Since ψ G
M
is a CH(M)-module homomorphism commuting with the degree maps (Proposition 2.29
and Remark 2.30), it is enough to show that
ϕG
ψ F CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ) and CH(MG ) ⊗ Jα (MG ) are orthogonal in CH(MG ) ⊗ CH(MG ).
M M
For this, we use the commutative diagram of pullback and pushforward maps

Since Jα (MG ) ⊆ Hα (MG ), the above follows from the ﬁrst orthogonality for MG .

We next show that the restriction of the Poincaré pairing of CH(M) to each summand
appearing in the right-hand side of (D3 ) is nondegenerate.
Lemma 5.2. Let F be a nonempty proper ﬂat of M, and let k = rkM (F ).
(1) The restriction of the Poincaré pairing of CH(M) to Hα (M) is nondegenerate.
(2) The restriction of the Poincaré pairing of CH(M) to ψ F
CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ) is nonM
degenerate.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from Proposition 2.32. We prove the second statement.
Let N = CH(MF ) ⊗ Jα (MF ) and Ni = CH(MF ) ⊗ Jiα (MF ). Notice that
Jiα (MF ) ∼

Q,

0 ⩽ i ⩽ k − 2;

otherwise.

Therefore, the total dimensions of Ni are the same for 0 ⩽ i ⩽ k − 2. For the second

Assuming that ν1 ∈ Jkα1 (MF ) and ν2 ∈ Jα
(MF ), the above expression vanishes unless
k1 + k2 = k − 1 or k − 2. In other words, the subspaces Ni and Nk−2−j are orthogonal
with respect to the bilinear form on N , unless i = j or i = j + 1. So the bilinear form can
be represented by a block lower-triangular matrix, and its nondegeneracy is equivalent
to the nondegeneracy of each diagonal block. Thus, it suﬃces to show that the induced
pairing between Ni and Nk−2−i is nondegenerate.

For this, assume that ν1 ∈ Jiα (MF ) and ν2 ∈ Jα
(MF ). By the above arguments,
we have

degMF (αMF ν1 ν2 ) = 0. The nondegeneracy of the pairing between Ni and Nk−2−i follows
from the nondegeneracy of the Poincaré pairing of CH(MF ). 
To complete the proof, we only need to show that the graded vector spaces on both
sides of (D3 ) have the same dimension, which is the next proposition.
Proposition 5.3. There exists an isomorphism of graded vector spaces

F ∈Q(M)

where the sum is over the set Q(M) of proper ﬂats of M with rank at least two.
Proof. We prove the proposition using induction on the cardinality of E. Suppose the
proposition holds for any matroid whose ground set is a proper subset of E. Suppose
that there exists an element i ∈ E that is not a coloop.
By Remark 3.6, for any G in Si , we have xG∪i CH(i) ∼

graded vector spaces. Thus, the decomposition (D1 ) implies

By applying the induction hypothesis to the matroids M \ i and MG , we see that the
left-hand side of (D3 ) is isomorphic to the graded vector space

Now, we further decompose the right-hand side of (D3 ) to match the displayed expression. For this, we split the index set Q(M) into three groups:
(1) F ∈ Q(M), i ∈ F, F \ i ∈ Si (M),
(2) F ∈ Q(M), i ∈ F, F \ i ∈

Remark 5.4. The decomposition of graded vector spaces appearing in [1, Theorem 6.18]
specializes to decompositions of CH(M) and of CH(M), where the latter goes through
Remark 4.1. At the level of Poincaré polynomials, these decompositions coincide with
those of Theorem 1.8. However, the subspaces appearing in the decompositions are not
the same. In particular, the decompositions in [1, Theorem 6.18] are not orthogonal, and
they are not compatible with the Hα (M)-module structure on CH(M) or the Hα (M)module structure on CH(M).
