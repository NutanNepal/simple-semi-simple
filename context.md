# Project Context: The Semi-Small Project

## 1. Primary Objective

The core goal of this project is to find a new, elementary, and purely algebraic proof for the formula of the **Poincaré polynomial of a matroid's Chow ring**, denoted `H_M(t)`. The existing proofs, found in the work of Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot, and Wang (BHMPW), rely on deep and complex geometric machinery (specifically, the semi-small decomposition of the Chow ring). Our aim is to develop a more direct proof by adapting algebraic techniques from related areas of combinatorics.

## 2. Core Hypothesis & Strategy

The central strategy is to **adapt the algebraic framework developed by Braden and Vysogorets (BV) for Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL) polynomials of matroids.**

The BV framework involves:
- An algebraic module, denoted `H(M)`, which is a free module over `Z[t, t⁻¹]` with a basis corresponding to the flats of the matroid `M`.
- A "deletion" homomorphism, `Δ: H(M) -> H(M\e)`, which describes how elements behave upon deleting an element `e` from the matroid's ground set.
- A special class of "perverse" elements in `H(M)` whose structure is key to deriving recursive formulas.

**Our central hypothesis is that a similar structure exists for the Poincaré polynomials.** We will define a "Chow-Poincaré element" in the module `H(M)` and conjecture that it satisfies a key "perversity" condition under the action of the deletion homomorphism `Δ`. Proving this conjecture should lead directly to the desired recursive formula for `H_M(t)`.

## 3. Key Mathematical Objects

- **Matroid (M):** A combinatorial structure generalizing the notion of linear independence.
- **Lattice of Flats (L(M)):** The set of "closed" subsets of the matroid's ground set, ordered by inclusion.
- **Module H(M):** The free `Z[t, t⁻¹]`-module with basis `{F | F ∈ L(M)}`. This is our primary algebraic workspace.
- **Deletion Homomorphism (Δ):** The map from `H(M)` to `H(M\e)` defined in the BV paper.
- **Poincaré Polynomial of the Chow Ring (H_M(t)):** The target object of study from the BHMPW papers. It is a polynomial in `t` satisfying Poincaré duality: `H_M(t) = t^(d-1) * H_M(t⁻¹)`, where `d` is the rank of `M`.
- **Chow-Poincaré Element (C_M):** The central object we will define and study. It's an element in `H(M)` constructed as a sum: `C_M = Σ H_{M_F}(t) * F`, where the sum is over all flats `F` of `M`, and `M_F` is the contraction of `M` at `F`.
