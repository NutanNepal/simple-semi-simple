# Definitions Folder

This folder contains the formal mathematical definitions and objects that form the foundation of our research project.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive reference for all mathematical objects and structures we will be working with in our quest to find an elementary algebraic proof for the Poincaré polynomial formula of matroid Chow rings.

## Contents

### `mathematical_objects.md`
A comprehensive reference document containing:

1. **Basic Matroid Theory**
   - Matroid definition and axioms
   - Rank function
   - Flats and lattice of flats

2. **Algebraic Module Structure**
   - Module H(M) definition
   - Basis elements

3. **Operations**
   - Deletion and contraction operations
   - Deletion homomorphism Δ

4. **Key Objects**
   - Poincaré polynomial H_M(t)
   - Chow-Poincaré element C_M
   - Perverse elements

5. **Computational Framework**
   - Implementation goals
   - Key functions to implement

## Usage

This folder serves as:
- **Reference**: Quick lookup for definitions during implementation
- **Planning**: Guide for what needs to be implemented computationally
- **Documentation**: Clear record of mathematical objects for future reference
- **Communication**: Shared vocabulary for discussing the project

## Future Additions

As the project progresses, we may add:
- More detailed definitions of specific operations
- Examples of computations
- Implementation notes
- Proof sketches and strategies
