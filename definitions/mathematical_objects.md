# Mathematical Objects and Definitions

## 1. Basic Matroid Theory

### Matroid (M)
A matroid is a combinatorial structure that generalizes the notion of linear independence. Formally, a matroid consists of:
- A finite ground set E
- A collection of independent sets I ⊆ 2^E satisfying:
  - ∅ ∈ I (empty set is independent)
  - If A ∈ I and B ⊆ A, then B ∈ I (hereditary property)
  - If A, B ∈ I with |A| < |B|, then there exists e ∈ B \ A such that A ∪ {e} ∈ I (exchange property)

### Rank Function
For a matroid M on ground set E, the rank function r: 2^E → ℕ is defined by:
r(A) = max{|B| : B ⊆ A and B is independent}

### Flats
A flat (or closed set) of a matroid M is a subset F ⊆ E such that for any e ∈ E \ F, we have r(F ∪ {e}) = r(F) + 1.

### Lattice of Flats (L(M))
The set of all flats of M, ordered by inclusion. This forms a geometric lattice.

## 2. Algebraic Module Structure

### Module H(M)
The free ℤ[t, t⁻¹]-module with basis {F | F ∈ L(M)}, where L(M) is the lattice of flats of M.

**Formal Definition:**
H(M) = {Σ a_F(t) · F | a_F(t) ∈ ℤ[t, t⁻¹], F ∈ L(M)}

### Basis Elements
Each flat F ∈ L(M) corresponds to a basis element in H(M), denoted simply as F.

## 3. Deletion and Contraction Operations

### Deletion (M \ e)
For a matroid M and element e ∈ E, the deletion M \ e is the matroid on ground set E \ {e} with independent sets:
I(M \ e) = {I ⊆ E \ {e} | I ∈ I(M)}

### Contraction (M / F)
For a flat F of M, the contraction M / F is the matroid on ground set E \ F with rank function:
r_{M/F}(A) = r_M(A ∪ F) - r_M(F)

### Contraction at Flat (M_F)
The contraction of M at flat F, denoted M_F, is the matroid M / F.

### Restriction (M|F)
For a flat F of M, the restriction M|F is the matroid on ground set F with independent sets:
I(M|F) = {I ⊆ F | I ∈ I(M)}

### Restriction at Flat (M^F)
The restriction of M at flat F, denoted M^F, is the matroid M|F.


**Key Properties:**
- M|F is a matroid of rank r_M(F)
- The flats of M|F are precisely the flats of M that are contained in F
- M|F is the "local" structure of M within the flat F

## 4. Chow Ring

### Chow Ring (A*(M))
The Chow ring of a matroid M is a graded commutative ring that encodes the combinatorial structure of the matroid. It is defined as:

A*(M) = ℤ[x_F | F ∈ L(M) \ {∅, E}] / I

where:
- The variables x_F correspond to non-empty, non-maximal flats F
- I is the ideal generated by:
  1. **Linear relations:** For every pair of distinct elements i1, i2 ∈ E, we have Σ_{i1 ∈ F} x_F = Σ_{i2 ∈ F} x_F
  2. **Quadratic relations:** For any two incomparable flats F, G, we have x_F · x_G = 0

**Note:** The linear relations state that for any two distinct elements i1 and i2, the sum of all variables x_F corresponding to flats F containing i1 must equal the sum of all variables x_F corresponding to flats F containing i2. This formulation is necessary because we exclude the maximal flat E from our variables. If we had included x_E, the relations would instead be Σ_{e ∈ F} x_F = 0 for each element e.

### Grading
The Chow ring A*(M) is graded by degree, where:
- A^0(M) = ℤ
- A^1(M) is generated by {x_F | F is a coatom (rank r-1 flat)}
- A^i(M) consists of elements of degree i

### Poincaré Duality
The Chow ring satisfies Poincaré duality: there is a perfect pairing
A^i(M) × A^{d-i}(M) → ℤ
where d = r(M) - 1 is the dimension of the Chow ring.

### FY-Monomials (Feichtner-Yuzvinsky Basis)
The Chow ring A(M) admits a special Z-basis called the **FY-monomials** (from the ANR paper on Chow rings as permutation representations). This basis provides a natural way to understand the structure of the Chow ring and is crucial for computations.

**Definition:** The FY-monomials are defined as:
FY := {x_F1^m1 x_F2^m2 ··· x_Fℓ^mℓ : (∅ =: F0) ⊊ F1 ⊊ F2 ⊊ ··· ⊊ Fℓ, and mi ≤ rk(Fi) - rk(Fi-1) - 1}

**Key Properties:**
- The FY-monomials form a Z-basis for A(M)
- Each FY-monomial has a nested chain of flats F1 ⊊ F2 ⊊ ··· ⊊ Fℓ
- The exponents mi are bounded by mi ≤ rk(Fi) - rk(Fi-1) - 1
- The subset FYk of FY-monomials of total degree k gives a Z-basis for A^k
- A^r has Z-basis {x_E^r}, giving a Z-module isomorphism deg: A^r → Z sending x_E^r ↦ 1

**Gröbner Basis:** The ideal I + J has a monic Gröbner basis {g_F,F'} indexed by F ≠ F' in F, which leads to the FY-monomial basis.

**Group Action:** For any matroid M, the group G = Aut(M) permutes the set FY, endowing A^k with the structure of a permutation representation.

## 5. Deletion Homomorphism

### Deletion Homomorphism (Δ)
A homomorphism Δ: H(M) → H(M \ e) that describes how elements behave upon deleting an element e from the matroid's ground set.

**Key Properties:**
- Δ is a ℤ[t, t⁻¹]-module homomorphism
- Δ respects the structure of flats under deletion

## 6. Poincaré Polynomial

### Poincaré Polynomial of Chow Ring (H_M(t))
The target object of study from the BHMPW papers. It is a polynomial in t satisfying Poincaré duality:

H_M(t) = t^(d-1) · H_M(t⁻¹)

where d is the rank of M.

**Properties:**
- H_M(t) ∈ ℤ[t]
- H_M(1) = number of bases of M
- H_M(t) satisfies Poincaré duality
- H_M(t) = Σ_{i=0}^d dim(A^i(M)) · t^i

## 7. Chow-Poincaré Element

### Chow-Poincaré Element (C_M)
The central object we will define and study. It's an element in H(M) constructed as a sum:

C_M = Σ H_{M_F}(t) · F

where:
- The sum is over all flats F of M
- M_F is the contraction of M at F
- H_{M_F}(t) is the Poincaré polynomial of the Chow ring of M_F

**Key Conjecture:**
C_M satisfies a "perversity" condition under the action of the deletion homomorphism Δ.

## 8. Perverse Elements

### Perverse Elements
A special class of elements in H(M) whose structure is key to deriving recursive formulas. The exact definition will be adapted from the BV framework for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.

**Expected Properties:**
- Perverse elements have specific behavior under the deletion homomorphism Δ
- The Chow-Poincaré element C_M is conjectured to be perverse
- Perversity should lead to recursive formulas for H_M(t)

## 9. Recursive Formulas

### Deletion-Contraction Formula
The goal is to derive a recursive formula for H_M(t) of the form:

H_M(t) = f(H_{M\e}(t), H_{M/e}(t), t)

where f is some polynomial function and e is an element of the ground set.

## 10. Examples and Testing

### Small Matroids for Testing
- **Uniform Matroid U(2,4):** A matroid of rank 2 on 4 elements
- **Graphic Matroids:** Matroids arising from graphs
- **Representable Matroids:** Matroids that can be represented as vector configurations
